# AGCapital-Challenge-Api

This is the Back-end for challenge for a vacation jog on AG Capital (It's not a requirement, it's justo my Bonus for challenge)

- **Lifecycle Management:** Functionality to close or reopen projects;
- **Task Management:** Activity control per project, allowing task management and status transitions between "Todo", "Doing", "Done", and "Cancelled";
- **Search and Filtering:** Search functionality for projects and clients, including tab-based filters for project status (open or closed).
- **Integration and State Management:** Mock integrations using a state manager
